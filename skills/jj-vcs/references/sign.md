## Usage

jj sign [OPTIONS]

## Options

* -r, --revision <REVSETS>
  What revision(s) to sign
  If no revisions are specified, this defaults to the `revsets.sign` setting.
  Note that revisions are always re-signed.
  While that leads to discomfort for users, which sign with hardware devices, as of now we cannot reliably check if a commit is already signed by the user without creating a signature (see [#5786]).
  [#5786]: https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/issues/5786

* --key <KEY>
  The key used for signing

* -h, --help
  Print help (see a summary with '-h')
